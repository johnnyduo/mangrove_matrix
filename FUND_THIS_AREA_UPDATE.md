# Fund This Area - Annual CC Return Update

## âœ… **Updated Components:**

### FundingModal.tsx
- **Annual CC Return**: Updated from "2.5%" â†’ "250%"
- **Platform Fee**: Remains "2.5%" (correct, this is the staking fee)

### FundingModalNew.tsx  
- **Annual CC Return**: Updated from "2.5%" â†’ "250%"
- **Platform Fee**: Remains "2.5%" (correct, this is the staking fee)

## ðŸ“Š **Math Verification:**

### Original Rate (0.025 CC per USDC per year):
- 1 USDC staked â†’ 0.025 CC earned per year
- Return = 0.025 CC / 1 USDC = 2.5%

### New Rate (2.5 CC per USDC per year):
- 1 USDC staked â†’ 2.5 CC earned per year  
- Return = 2.5 CC / 1 USDC = 250%

## ðŸŽ¯ **Result:**

The "Fund This Area" sections in both funding modals now correctly display:
- **Annual CC Return: 250%** (reflects the new faster emission rate)
- **Platform Fee: 2.5%** (unchanged, this is the MangroveStaking contract fee)

Users will now see the accurate annual return rate when they're considering funding a mangrove area, making it clear that they'll earn 2.5 CC tokens for every USDC staked per year.
