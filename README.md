## üíª Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- Git
- WalletConnect Project ID from [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd MangroveMatrix

# Install dependencies (using yarn is recommended)
yarn install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your WalletConnect Project ID and MapBox token

# Start development server
yarn dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` to see the application.

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Required: WalletConnect Project ID from https://cloud.reown.com
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here

# Optional: MapBox token for enhanced map features
